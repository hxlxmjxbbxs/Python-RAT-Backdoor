Cybercrime is a collection of hackers, coders, and script kiddies working together to
        
ensure digital peace and privacy for every user. From the normal users to the
        
mighty sys admin, we work to improve the innocent users of the internet's 
        
fragile digital life. We will work to take down websites and corporations that
        
intrude upon the people of the internet's privacy and fight for free 
        
information for all. We hope that you (if you have the knowledge and skill
        
needed) will join our ranks, and ensure that the internet will last and
        
remain free for generations to come.


CYBERCRIME Today, Tomorrow, FOREVER.
